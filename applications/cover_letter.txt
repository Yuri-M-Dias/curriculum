Dear <Person>,

my name is Yuri Matheus Dias and Iâ€™m submitting an application for the
<Job> you advertised on <Software>.

I'm a recent undergraduate at Software Engineering by the Federal
University of Goias, in Brazil, and I have about one year and a half
web development experience by internships at local companies. I'm
active on GitHub at https://github.com/Yuri-M-Dias, though it's mostly
made of school projects and other interesting trivia.

I am interested in DevOps culture, which I was usually in charge of at
college, agile culture, and general software engineering practices. I
also love to read all sort of books, articles, and audiobooks, so I
get to train a lot of English reading and listening daily.

I feel that I could learn a lot from the current position and that I
can contribute to something that'll help people in need for
technological advancements. I believe that I am ready for delivering
production-ready software and that I can easily adapt to whatever's
necessary to learn.

<Place anything more specfic to this job here>

Let me know if you want to discuss this position further. Thank you
for your time.

Best wishes,
Yuri Matheus Dias
